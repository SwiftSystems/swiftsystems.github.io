            <h1>About the Developer</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a 15 years old and I've been programming since I was 11, I<br>
                the age of 11, but I still always learn new things.<br><br>
                I made Swift Systems as a way to test myself, to see if I can push<br>
                games to their breaking points, while trying to have fun in the process.<br><br>
                If you have any questions/concerns or just want to have a conversation,<br>
                feel free to reach out to me at Swift#9738 (or join the discord server)<br>
                as I'm always up to talk!
            </p>

            <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, you can't choose to use Swift Systems at<br>
                this time, as the script is still very much in development.<br><br>
                However when the time comes for the script to be released<br>
                publicly, Swift Systems will have more features than similar<br>
                scripts, support tons of games, and not to mention, Swift Systems<br>
                will get tons of updates- insuring top performance at all times!
